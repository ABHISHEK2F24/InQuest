<br>
<br>        
*          The participants need to register in teams of maximum 3 individuals. They can also participate (register) as individual or in a team of 2.<br>
*          More preference (for selection) will be given to teams of 3, followed by 2 and then individual participation. <br>
*          Participants will be given a pool of research papers, out of which theyâ€™ll have to select minimum 3 in a preference order.<br>
*          There are some research papers in each pool reserved exclusively for teams having all participants from 1st and 2nd year participants.<br>
*          The participants will be asked a few questions before finishing the form. They will be ranked on the basis of their answers to the given questions.<br>
*          The selected participants will be given a research paper based on their preference order.<br>
*          In case of two teams having a preference dispute their ranking (see rule 5) will be considered and the team with higher preference will be selected first.<br>
*           In case of team ranking and paper assigning, decision of the committee stands final. No complaints will be entertained in this matter.<br>
